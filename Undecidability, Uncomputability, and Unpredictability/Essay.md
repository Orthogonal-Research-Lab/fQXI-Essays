### Introduction

          "<i>A little bit of many things, but mostly the things that cannot be easily coded</i>"

This quote is taken from the description for Bradly Alicea's Github repository. At first look, this might be the perfect description of a generalist with a range of unruly interests. This is of course a subjective take, but does bring up a conceptual point. Unruliness can be used as a way to describe what we cannot formalize. Unruly problems are messy, but can also include so-called wicked problems. Such problems are hard to represent with mathematics and sometimes even with words. However, they are not inherently qualitative or structureless! As Wigner once proposed that mathematics is unreasonable in its effectiveness [1], so we might also propose that poorly-represented problems have elusive answers.  

These types of problems are hard to represent, but not always for the lack of mathematical tools. Examples include systems with a large number of variable or high degrees of nonlinearity relative to methods such as experimental design or measurement of nearest-neighbor interactions. Inverse problems of highly-interacting systems such as swarm intelligence can also be classified in this way. While solutions can be proposed, this essay focuses on the need for a new paradigm for solving such problems.

### What makes a problem hard-to-represent?

#### Difficult to quantify
While many problems can be easily quantified, many other problems cannot. In a related manner, even many quantifiable problems do not yield clear quantitative structure. Quantitative structure refers to separability (gaps and difference), alignment (function and curve-fitting), and correspondance (one set of datapoints correspnd to an analogous set). The alternative to structure, however, is "grey goo" [2], or a smearing of categories and distinction. There is an unexplored link between highly-qualitative problems and randomness, although our perceptual systems impose order upon these problems as well. 

Do we need a new field called percpetual statistics where different mental models yield unique structural observations, while emsemble models produce consensus views of ontological structure? If so, then ontological structure forms the basis of a new way to properly quantify systems that would otherwise be difficult to attach numeric or symbolic systems.  

#### Difficult to symbolize and represent
As numbers and operators are symbols, it is worth asking whether some systems are hard to symbolize. If a problem is hard to define (such as wicked problems), then they may also be difficult to symbolize. A symbol is a compact representation of some feature or process, and we can turn to cybernetics to understand why some systems are easier to reduce to a symbolic representation than others. 

If "a theory is a metaphor between model and data", as Julian Jaynes said [JJ], then we must consider the metaphors that we use in creating theories and intepreting data. These metaphors might be intentionally selected because they provide easy access to the language of quantificaiton. In the next section, we will discuss problems for which there is no physical analogue. The idea that data needs to interface with such a model is largely an illusion. In addition, there are systems for which existing models and metaphors extending them to data are simply insufficient. In such cases, even physical metaphors are insufficient to the task of making quantification easier.

One class of such problems are known as "wicked" problems [3]. Wicked problems incorporate many different types of system, but have been characterized by large social problems such as a planned economy, social change and persistence, or complex systems with many parallel components. A particular feature of wicked problems is that some of the variables and phenomena needed to characterize the problem are not predictable. While it is tempting to suggest that these phenomena are simply exist in a chaotic regime, it is more likely that unpredictable components are variables that produces unstructured data in a system that exhibits structure. 

#### Un-physical problems (no physical analogue)  
We often use physical analogues to address complex biological and social problems (the "velocity" of spent money, "jet engines" to propel organisms through water or air, "gas" models of social interactions). But how physical are these systems, and do analogues provide insight? In cases such as Psychophysics, there is an interaction with physical processes. It may also be that such metaphors rest on problems and systems that are easy to quantify and symbolize.  

### Questions that result from these issues  

How can we represent such problems both mathematically and computationally? Is there a type of logical framework that might supercede conventional mathematics in these cases?

Do we need a new model for computation (continuous, stochastic), or can our current models sufficiently account for difficult-to-characterize or even wicked problems?  

Is there a connection with the ability to replicate experiments? In the case of experiments that are found not to replicate, is there a methodological problem, or is it a matter of not using the proper representation (what are key variables, or what is key mode of inquiry)? 

### Is a paradigm for measurement and computation the answer? 
>>>>> A new paradigm: physical cognition. Given this discussion, we might ask whether a new paradigm is needed. Indeed, while a new computational and quantitative paradigm may be hard to reconcile with traditional mathematics and computer science, it may help us overcome some of the limitations of tradition.

An outline of four potential approaches are as follows:

1) continuous methods that use the behavior of fluids, biological collectives, or soft materials as inspiration.
While continuous approximation has become increasing easier with advances in computing technology, this requires an ability to capture the phenomenon of interest using methods that make such systems quantifiable. To bridge this conceptual gap, we can map such systems onto fluids, biological collectives, and soft materials. While these mappings are quasi-quantitative, our mathematical understanding of such systems are a bit more tractable than the alternative.


2) the prediction of intervals that allow us to find patterns in stochastic sequences.
Another way in which difficult to quantify systems can be turned into mathematical grist is through interval and difference computing [4]. Interval and difference computing requires us to define these features in the system of interest. One promising technique is to use the features of natural systems as a tool for computation. Interval computation can be done in this way using neural models [5] and neural-inspired models such as dendritic computing [6]. 


3) geometric generativity and isometric networks.
The construction of nested and overlapping shapes, in addition to isometric networks, can be used to represent sets of relationships that possess non-transitive properties, recursivity, and co-varying higher dimensionality. 
     
We will discuss isometric networks first. Isometric networks consist of a series of interconnected isometric shapes. Isometric geometries have been used in art and video game design. Isometric networks are drawn in 2-dimensions, but due to their orientation, project 3-dimensions of information. moreover, due to this projection, the second and third dimensions are entangled, leading to shared variance amongst both dimensions.

While isometric networks can represent transitive relationships, we can configure such networks (and particularly their growth) in such a way so as to introduce nontransitive elements. Nested and overlapping shapes drawn as a generative landscape might be a way to introduce such properties. Much as injecting stochasticity into boolean models make them more lifelike, so can injecting generativity into simple geometric systems gets us closer to what Douglas Hofstadter refers to as a strange loop. 
     

4) fuzzy multidimensionality and associative methods.
While traditional statistical methods allow us to discover associations, we might want to discover free associations that are harder to define in terms of a feature space. This is where we can use fuzzy logic in multidimensional space to help us create intervals which can also be used to facilitate interval and difference computing.
