### Introduction  
<p align="center">
          "<i>A little bit of many things, but mostly the things that cannot be easily coded</i>"

This quote is taken from the description for Bradly Alicea's Github repository. At first look, this might be the perfect description of a generalist with a range of unruly interests. This is of course a subjective take, but does bring up a conceptual point. Unruliness can be used as a way to describe what we cannot formalize. Unruly problems are messy, but can also include so-called wicked problems. Such problems are hard to represent with mathematics and sometimes even with words. However, they are not inherently qualitative or structureless!  As Weiner once proposed that mathematics is unreasonable effective, so we might also propose that poorly-represented problems have elusive answers.  

These types of problems are hard to represent, but not always for the lack of mathematical tools. Examples include systems with a large number of variable or high degrees of nonlinearity relative to methods such as experimental design or measurement of nearest-neighbor interactions. Inverse problems of highly-interacting systems such as swarm intelligence can also be classified in this way. While solutions can be proposed, this essay focuses on the need for a new paradigm for solving such problems.

### What makes a problem hard-to-represent?

#### Difficult to quantify
While many problems can be easily quantified, many other problems cannot. In a related manber, even many quantifiable problems do not yield clear quantitative structure. Quantitative structure refers to separability (gaps and difference), alignment (function and curve-fitting), and correspondance (one set of datapoints correspnd to an analogous set). The alternative to structure, however, is "grey goo", or a smearing of categories and distinction. There is an unexplored link between highly-qualitative problems and randomness, although our perceptual systems impose order upon these problems as well. 

Do we need a new field called percpetual statistics where different mental models yield unique structural observations, while emsemble models produce consensus views of ontological structure? If so, then ontological structure forms the basis of a new way to properly quantify systems that would otherwise be difficult to attach numeric or symbolic systems.  

#### Difficult to symbolize  
As numbers and operators are symbols, it is worth asking whether some systems are hard to symbolize. If a problem is hard to define (such as wicked problems), then they may also be difficult to symbolize. A symbol is a compact representation of some feature or process, and we can turn to cybernetics to understand why some systems are easier to reduce to a symbolic representation than others.  

#### Un-physical problems (no physical analogue)  
We often use physical analogues to address complex biological and social problems (the "velocity" of spent money, "jet engines" to propel organisms through water or air, "gas" models of social interactions). But how physical are these systems, and do analogues provide insight? In cases such as Psychophysics, there is an interaction with physical processes. It may also be that such metaphors rest on problems and systems that are easy to quantify and symbolize.  

### Questions that result from these issues  

How can we represent such problems both mathematically and computationally? Is there a type of logical framework that might supercede conventional mathematics in these cases?

Do we need a new model for computation (continuous, stochastic)?  

Is there a connection with the ability to replicate experiments? In the case of experiments that are found not to replicate, is there a methodological problem, or is it a matter of not using the proper representation (what are key variables, or what is key mode of inquiry)? 

### A new paradigm: physical cognition  
We propose a geometric and relational system for representing such problems. A structural approach involves using geometric shapes as an invariant foundation for everything else in a system.
