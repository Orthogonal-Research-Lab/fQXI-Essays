## Title: a variation on "Elusive Answers to Poorly-represented Problems"
fQXI essay (outline):  
  
Bradly Alicea's Github repo tagline: "A little bit of many things, but mostly the things that cannot be easily coded"

* generalist with a range of unruly interests.

* "unruly" meaning hard-to-represent with mathematics (and sometimes with words!). But not qualitative or structureless!

* "Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics" ---> "Elusive Answers to Poorly-represented Problems"?

1) difficult to quantify.

While many problems can be easily quantified, many other problems cannot. In a related manber, even many quantifiable problems do not yield clear quantitative structure. Quantitative structure refers to separability (gaps and difference), alignment (function and curve-fitting), and correspondance (one set of datapoints correspnd to an analogous set). The alternative to structure, however, is "grey goo", or a smearing of categories and distinction. There is an unexplored link between highly-qualitative problems and randomness, although our perceptual systems impose order upon these problems as well. 

Do we need a new field called percpetual statistics where different mental models yield unique structural observations, while emsemble models produce consensus views of ontological structure? If so, then ontological structure forms the basis of a new way to properly quantify systems that would otherwise be difficult to attach numbers.

2) difficult to symbolize. 

As numbers and operators are symbols, it is worth asking whether some systems are hard to symbolize. If a problem is hard to define (such as wicked problems), then they may also be difficult to symbolize. A symbol is a compact representation of some feature or process, and we can turn to cybernetics to understand why some systems are easier to reduce to a symbolic representation than others. 

3) un-physical problems (no physical analogue).

We often use physical analogues to address complex biological and social problems (the "velocity" of spent money, "jet engines" to propel diatoms through water, "gas" models of social interactions). But how physical are these systems, and do analogues provide insight? In cases such as Psychophysics, there is an interaction with physical processes. It may also be that such metaphors rest on problems and systems that are easy to quantify and symbolize. 



* how can we represent such problem mathematically and computationally?
